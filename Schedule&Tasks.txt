Tasks to be completed before presentation:

-Get Base Docker and setup working (Run basic code to ensure it works)
-Read and understand base code to ensure we know what part does what.
-Add command line arguments for things such as input file/directory, mode, parameters, etc.
-Create nice clean "main" function so that we can use these parameters and flags to have the program do various things based on the arguments.

-Create function that will merge these individual frames into a .gif
